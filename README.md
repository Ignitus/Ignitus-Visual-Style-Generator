# Ignitus-Visual-Style-Generator
Repository for developing new visual style guide for Ignitus Paper

# Introduction
The Ignitus-Visual-Style-Generator repository is concerned with the development of new visual features for enhancement of Ignitus Paper(s). The core idea is to read and learn from the different publishers and to understand how each University and Corporation communicate  visually  their  math-origin  results.  As  a  second stage,  ”pythonize”  to  replicate  such  visual  standards by creating Visualizing Templates. And as a final stage, create something new for Ignitus. That is, all of this relates to create a visual style for Ignitus papers.

# Topics to Focus on
The topics which needs to be focused while creating visualizing templates for the Ignitus Paper are as follows:
### 1) Pagination
Pagination is the automated process of adding consecutive numbers to identify the seqential order of pages, it is done to improve the readibiility, improve searchibility of a content, and indexing.
Read in detail about pagination [here](https://gist.github.com/mislav/622561)
Helpful Modules : [Paginate](https://pypi.org/project/paginate/])

### 2) Intendation
An indentation is the space at the beginning of a line of writing when it starts further away from the edge of the paper than all the other lines.

### 3) Research Paper Style
All in all, there are two most common research paper styles and a number of minor ones.
One of the research paper styles is the ***APA (American Psychological Association)*** writing format. This style is used for writing research papers on science, psychology and other related subjects. It implies a schematic citation which allows authors to insert external information from related sources. When using this citation format, the overall writing style needs to be aligned with the APA style. The title of the project has to be written beside the page number on the top right-hand corner of each page. Also, the bibliography page needs to contain all necessary information about the original source.
Another research paper style which you may use is the ***MLA (Modern Language Association style)*** writing format. MLA style is preferable when writing materials in Social Sciences and Humanities. This writing format has much in common with APA, but the difference lies in the pagination process. When using MLA, the author’s last name, and not the research paper title, needs to be written beside the page number. There is also a difference in the bibliography page, where entries are not directly the same with those of APA.
Other applicable research paper styles which you may use are ***Harvard, Chicago*** and ***Turabian*** writing formats. All of them are practically the same, but have some local variants. It is necessary to mention, that every higher educational establishment has its own, so called “house”, writing format, which is based on one of the two main writing styles.

### 4) Citation Style
 A "citation" is the way you tell your readers that certain material in your work came from another source. It also gives your readers the information necessary to find that source again, including: information about the author. the title of the work.

### 5) DPI
The DPI values are only metadata on computer images. They give hints on how to display or print
an image. Printing a 360 x 360 image with 360 DPI will result in a 11 inches printout. A simplified way to explain
it: The DPI setting recommends a zoom level for the image. Saving with other DPIs will not change the content of the
image. If you want a larger image use a larger size and a larger font. Image resolution, number of pixels and print size
are related mathematically: Pixels = Resolution (DPI) Print size (in inches). The various famous libraries for plotting and
saving images are
* Plotly
* matplotlib
* Seaborn
* ggplot
* bokeh
* pygal
* geoplotlib
* gleam
* missingno
* Leather.
