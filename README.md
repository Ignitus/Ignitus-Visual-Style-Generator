# Ignitus-Visual-Style-Generator
Repository for developing new visual style guide for Ignitus Paper

# Introduction
The Ignitus-Visual-Style-Generator repository is concerned with the development of new visual features for enhancement of Ignitus Paper(s). The core idea is to read and learn from the different publishers and to publish a short essay about how each University and Corporation communicate  visually  their  math-origin  results.  As  a  second stage,  ”pythonize”  to  replicate  such  visual  standards. And as a final stage, create something new for Ignitus. That is, all of this relates
to create a visual style for Ignitus papers.
